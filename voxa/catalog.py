"""Discover current models from Ollama's library so the catalog does not go stale.

The registry API cannot be used for this: /v2/_catalog and
/v2/library/<name>/tags/list both answer 404, so it can only confirm names that
are already known. The library index at https://ollama.com/library does list
every family, and each family's /tags page lists its tags with the download
size, context window and modality in the visible text. That is enough to notice
a model that did not exist when this code was written -- when a new generation
lands, it appears in the index under the same stem and is picked up without a
release.

Two failure modes are designed around. An unreachable site must never be read as
"every model has been withdrawn", so anything short of a successful parse raises
and leaves the caller's existing catalog alone. And the parse depends on the
page's visible text rather than its CSS classes, so a redesign degrades to
"discovered nothing" rather than to wrong sizes.
